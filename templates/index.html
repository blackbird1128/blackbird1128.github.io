        If you enjoy the content made here, you can simply share it with your friends or colleagues using various social media.
        But this place will probably never have a way to discuss the content directly as I don't wanna deal with bots and moderation.

        <h2> Who am I ? </h2>

        <p>
        As I enjoy my privacy, I will not disclose my real name here. You can call me Jack, or Alice. I'm a 21 year old
        student in computer science, currently living in France. I started programming in high school with a friend. At first I was using C++ (yeah not the brightest idea) and Python and I learned a lot of concepts, some too quickly to understand them correctly. But it made me realize something, I loved programming, and for my high school self, it was one of the coolest thing ever. So computer science was the obvious choice for college. A few years later, i still love programming and I decided to write this blog to share my passion.
        </p>
        <h2> What is this blog about ? </h2>

        <p> Well, it's about a lot of things, i plan to write mostly about my computer science projects but also about books I enjoyed, movie I watched and loved, and maybe some random thoughts about life.
        </p>

        <p> This blog is also a way to write in english, as I'm not a native speaker, it offers me a way to improve my english.
        </p>

        <h2> Who is this blog for ? </h2>
